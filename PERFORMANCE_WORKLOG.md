# Anthology performance worklog

Branch: `anthology-monolith-ixray-performance`

This branch adapts performance and loading work from xray-monolith, PR #614,
and IX-Ray to the Anthology engine. Changes are reviewed and integrated by
subsystem; upstream branches are not merged wholesale.

## Integration rules

- Preserve Anthology UI, PiP, renderer behavior, scripts, and save compatibility.
- Keep render-owned and Lua-owned state on their owner threads.
- Separate loading, runtime threading, and diagnostics into reviewable commits.
- Build and validate DX11-AVX before installing a candidate.
- Keep full local `bin` backups; do not commit binaries or local backups.
- Record the source, adaptation, risks, validation, and user test result here.

## Baseline — 2026-07-31

- Base commit: `4d696f47` (`fix: remove incompatible Lua bytecode cache`).
- Installed v44 EXE SHA-256:
  `33B178321AFEDD11B5348BD480FA1E98491CEBF1B99938098C5F05340660F3BC`.
- Stable fixes retained:
  - parallel native level preparation and process-local level cache;
  - sparse precache rendering with all 60 logical callbacks preserved;
  - startup VFS/source preparation;
  - owner-thread protection for UI, PiP, dynamic textures, and level transitions;
  - detailed load-session diagnostics.
- Latest measured save load: `17.947 s` for 43,137 objects.
- Current dominant phases: Lua start callback about `8.8–9.0 s`; save/ALife
  restore about `5.9–6.3 s`.
- Rejected experiment: Lua bytecode caching. It saved only about `0.16 s` and
  broke case-sensitive addon namespaces, so it was fully removed.

## Research queue

- `themrdemonized/xray-monolith`: current and May-era runtime threading/frame pacing.
- `themrdemonized/xray-monolith#614`: loading implementation and follow-up fixes.
- IX-Ray development branch: transferable job-system, scheduler, render, and AI work.

## Source audit — 2026-07-31

Reference branches were fetched without merging them into Anthology:

- `upstream-themrdemonized/all-in-one-vs2022-wpo-mt`;
- `upstream-themrdemonized/pr-614` (13 commits from PR #614);
- `ixray-stcop/develop` and `ixray-stcop/default`.

### PR #614 loading work

- The PR parallelizes native level preparation while keeping Lua, spawning,
  renderer publication, and D3D11 immediate-context calls on their owner thread.
- Its own results show that hot-save loading changes very little (`-2.8%` in
  GAMMA and a small regression in vanilla). The PR explicitly identifies
  sequential Lua/ALife work as the remaining limit.
- Anthology v44 already contains adapted native preparation, R4 process-local
  level caching, sparse precache rendering, startup preparation, race fixes,
  and load-session diagnostics from this work.
- Therefore the next save-load work must target the measured Lua/ALife phases;
  duplicating renderer parallelism cannot turn the current 17.9 s load into 10 s.

### Monolith runtime MT audit

Already present in Anthology:

- scheduler split: real-time objects on the main thread and deferred objects in
  the secondary task group;
- idle-time parallel Lua GC;
- `CEnemyManager::useful` Lua-result cache with per-entity jitter;
- NPC sound callbacks in scheduled updates;
- sector/portal traversal work and multithreaded details.

Differences selected for compatibility review:

- current Monolith defaults `scheduler_batch_size` to 256 and allows a larger
  range, while Anthology currently defaults to 128 and caps it at 256;
- current Monolith has a simpler guarded details synchronization path; Anthology
  has additional load/unload protection that must be retained while removing
  redundant frame waits;
- IX-Ray particle loading reserves action storage before deserialization, a
  small and low-risk allocation optimization that is not present in Anthology.

Rejected or disabled-by-default upstream experiments:

- `mt_SchedulerRT`: upstream says it can cause problems; do not enable it;
- `mt_ui`: default-disabled and conflicts with the UI owner-thread rule;
- multithreaded HOM: previously disabled for border artifacts and later changed
  again; keep Anthology runtime HOM on the render thread;
- topological bone sorting: reverted upstream on 2026-05-24;
- ALife `xr_sparse_map`: repeatedly applied/reverted and finally reverted on
  2026-03-23; do not risk save compatibility with it.

### IX-Ray development branch

IX-Ray `develop` now has a substantially different renderer/RHI and task
architecture, so it cannot be merged or copied wholesale into Anomaly. The
safe route is the one used by Monolith: backport isolated algorithms and their
follow-up fixes. Current candidates are limited to compatible containers,
allocation reduction, wait/barrier fixes, and owner-thread-safe task usage.

## Candidate v45 — runtime barrier and load profiler

- Adapted the current Monolith details barrier: one guarded per-frame
  calculation replaces overlapping volatile flags and two `Sleep(0)` loops.
  Anthology's load/unload `Suspend`/`Publish` protection is retained.
- Updated the scheduler default to 256 and exposed the upstream-compatible
  upper range. RT objects remain on the main thread.
- Backported IX-Ray particle-action capacity reservation (source commit
  `04459cdaf9665857a2353351ac8bd928d12306a8`).
- Added owner-thread Lua load profiling. Each load session reports aggregate
  script self-time and the 20 slowest modules without changing callback order.
- Routine per-script debug spam is now opt-in with `-script_load_log`; errors,
  load-session diagnostics, and the rest of `-dbg` remain enabled.
- `DX11-AVX` build completed successfully. Candidate hashes:
  - EXE: `E9940BD3F601F6F6F368A361BE7DF51D39EA07344AB3068FC3AC4F5E8B4CDEC1`;
  - PDB: `9FDACAD822543CAE5743B50BED03BE55FFCA1E19AAD2B74555C93B5C0FAAC925`.
- Local `user.ltx` still contains `scheduler_batch_size 128`; installation of
  this candidate will back it up and set it to the upstream default of 256.

### v45 installation

- Full pre-install backup:
  `webcache/engine_v45_install_backup_20260731_204954` (17 files,
  663,827,486 bytes, including the previous `user.ltx`).
- Installed only `AnomalyDX11AVX.exe` and `AnomalyDX11AVX.pdb`; installed hashes
  match the candidate hashes above.
- Local scheduler setting changed from 128 to 256. The scheduler's existing
  per-frame time budget still limits work, so this raises capacity without
  moving real-time objects off the main thread.
- The game executable was not launched by the integration process.
